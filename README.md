## Projects
I've organized my projects into subdirectories based on the programming language they are written in. Feel free to explore and learn from my code:

- [Java Projects](/java-projects): Contains Java applications and programs that I've developed.
- [Python Projects](/python-projects): Houses Python scripts and projects I've worked on.
- [C Projects](/c-projects): Features C programs and projects that I've created.

Each project directory includes a README with details about the project, how to run it, and any additional information that might be useful.
